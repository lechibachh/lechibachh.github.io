I am a Master of Science candidate in **Financial Engineering** at [Lehigh University](https://www1.lehigh.edu/) (GPA 3.93/4.0), expecting to graduate in May 2025. Previously, I obtained my Bachelor of Commerce in Finance and Economics with First Class Honors from the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **optimization, machine learning, and finance**. I currently work on problems related to distributionally robust optimization (DRO), time series forecasting, and risk management in deregulated commodity markets.
