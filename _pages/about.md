Hi, I'm Bach.

I am a Research Assistant at the College of Engineering & Computer Science at VinUniversity.

I work under the supervision of Professor [Hong Thi Mai Chu](https://sites.google.com/view/hongtmchu) and Professor [Binh Tuan Nguyen](https://tbng.github.io/). Our research focuses on understanding the dynamics of machine learning through the lens of mathematics.
